                <p>Cocoa came to us early 2014, following my wife Stephanie's multiple organ transplants. There was a lot of sadness in our family as Stephanie had frequent hospitalizations and Cocoa was a comfort to my children during those hard times and they grew up together.</p>

                <h2>Adventures & Mischief</h2>

                <p>In retrospect, a French Brittany was probably not the best breed for our family—Brittanys are bird hunters, super smart, stubborn, and task focused. This led to many adventures, such as when she ate part of the steering wheel of my car when she was bored or the time she attempted to devour my glasses and wallet.</p>

                <p>She still hunted, mainly for food in every garbage can we had.</p>

                <p>But despite being stubborn and always pulling on the leash when we walked her, she was one of the sweetest dogs I've ever had. She laid by my feet while I worked and became the best lap dog ever.</p>
